Welcome to Jett Airlines, the still in-progress website for international and national flights.  
  
To launch our website:  
1) Clone this project. (You'd still be missing the .env file for the database).  
2) Type "npm i" in the "/Tatakae" and "/client" directories to install dependencies.   
3) Open 2 Terminals: One in "/Tatakae" directory and the other in "jett-airlines".   
4) Type "node app" in the first terminal and "npm start" in the second.  
5) Enjoy the Admin role.
